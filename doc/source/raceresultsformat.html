        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        
        This document provides a specification for Race Results Files used to share run race results.  While race results may be provided in a variety of
        human readable formats, such as PDF, html, text, etc., there is a need to provide these in a format convenient for automated processing.
        
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        
        This specification supports race result interchange within the Maryland State Road Runners Clubs of America (MD RRCA).  It is encouraged for use for race results
        anywhere.
        
        The format is particularly suited for run race results.  However, it could easily be adapted to bicycle races, or even swimming.
        
        <h2>Specification</h2>
        
        The specification includes allowable <a href="#filetypes">file types</a>, <a href="#filenaming">file naming</a>
        and <a href="#filecontents">file contents</a>, as well as information on <a href="#filetransmission">file transmission</a> and where to find the
        <a href="#filerepository">file repository</a>.
        
        <h3 id="filetypes">File Types</h3>
        
        The following file types are allowed.
        
        <ul>
            <li>text - text files are files which can be viewed in a text editor as columns of data fields
                <ul>
                    <li>columns are defined by the character positions of the heading fields</li>
                    <li>column first character position is the same as the first character position of the heading field</li>
                    <li>column last character position is two characters before the first character position of the
                    <b>next</b> heading field (or at the end of the record for the final column)</li>
                    <li>note this means that the column heading has to be left justified in the column</li>
                    <li>tab characters are permitted -- after a tab character the character position is considered to be at the next n*8 character
                    position boundary, where n is an integer</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>csv - comma separated value as specified within <a href=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180 target=_blank>RFC 4180</a>, with
            exceptions that line breaks are not permitted within fields</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 id=filenaming>File Naming</h3>
        
        Race Results Files are named as
        
        <p style="text-indent: 0.5in">
            yyyy-mm-dd-dist-name.ext
        </p> 
        where:
        <br>
        <table style="text-indent: 0.5in">
            <tr><td>yyyy</td><td>4 digit year for date of race</td></tr>
            <tr><td>mm</td><td>2 digit month for date of race, including leading zero if necessary</td></tr>
            <tr><td>dd</td><td>2 digit date for date of race, including leading zero if necessary</td></tr>
            <tr><td>dist</td><td>numeric race distance followed by <b>M</b> for miles, <b>m</b> for meters, <b>k</b> (or <b>K</b> or <b>km</b>) for kilometers, e.g., 10M, 5km, 400m</td></tr>
            <tr><td>name</td><td>name of race, free form text, with letters, numbers, spaces, underscores and hyphens permitted</td></tr>
            <tr><td>ext</td><td><b>txt</b> for text files, <b>csv</b> for csv files</td></tr>
        </table>
        
        <h3 id="filecontents">File Contents</h3>
        
        File contents are the file header for the first record, and the race results with a record for each race result.  The fields are aligned
        as defined in File Types above.  This section defines the permitted heading names, and describes the type of data to be found underneath
        those headings.
        <br><br>
        The headings may be of any case.  For instance, Name and name are equivalent.  Spaces after the headings are not significant, however, as noted
        above for text files, headings must start in the same character position as the data (i.e., headings must not be centered).
        <br><br>
        Alternate Headings are given, separated by commas.  Note the commas are not part of the alternate headings.
        <br><br>
        <b>Note: </b>column order is not specified or implied by the order of fields in this table, nor should it be assumed by any automated processing
        <br><br>        
        <table style="text-indent: 0.5in">
