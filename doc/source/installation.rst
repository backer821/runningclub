Administrator Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Considerations
------------------

* determine if you want this to be a single user system, meaning only one user can update membership data in the database, update race results and generate standings, or if you want multiple users to be able to access the system

    * an example of a multiuser system would be if one person is responsible for (say) the grand prix race series, and another person is responsible for (say) the decathlon race series

Requirements
--------------

* windows PC
* python 2.7.x 32 bit
* database installation alternatives
    * sqlite - single user database - downloads can be found at http://www.sqlite.org/download.html
    * mysql workbench - multi user database - downloads and prerequisites found at http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

User Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Prior to installation, the following should be installed on the target machine, in the following order:

* windows PC
* python 2.7.x 32 bit 
    * add C:\Python26;C:\Python26\Scripts;C:\cygwin\bin to PATH environment variable
    * setuptools
    
**python 2.7.3** -- downloads for python 2.7 can be found at `<http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/>`_ .   

* download the Windows x86 MSI Installer (or the x86-64 MSI Installer, if you have a 64 bit machine)
* run the MSI installer and accept all the defaults.  Note if you put the Python27 directory in the default location, <PYTHONHOME> will be C:\\Python27

**setuptools** -- Documentation on how to install setuptools, along with the package itself, can be found on the Python Package Index at `<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_.  You should install the setuptools targeted for python 2.7.

* download the latest file similar to setuptools-<version>.win32-py2.7.exe (must be py2.7.exe)
* run the installer and accept all the defaults

**pypi packages** - can be found on the Python Package Index at `<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_ .  Once setuptools has been installed, assuming internet access, these packages can be installed using easy_install, e.g., easy_install xlrd
    * xlwt
    * xlrd

Other packages
    * loutilities - see http://github.com/louking/loutilities
    * sqlalchemy - see http://www.sqlalchemy.org/ tested against 0.8.0b2
    
Assuming the requirements above have been installed, runningclub can be installed from any command window using the following (in this case <ver> is '1.1')::

    > cd <your-directory>
    > easy_install runningclub-1.1-py2.7.egg

**google database access**

* some running databases are stored in google cloud SQL.  In order to access a google database, you must visit https://developers.google.com/cloud-sql/docs/commandline and follow the instructions

    * install google application engine sdk; copy google directory from sdk to python site-packages directory; add google.pth containing './google\n' to site-packages directory
    * copy google_sql.py from https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/source/browse/trunk/python/google_sql.py to site-packages directory
    * run google sql cli::
    
        C:\unzipdirectory>google_sql.cmd fsrcrunning:fsrcrunningdb [get the instance name from your runningclub administrator]
        Please authorize Google SQL Service for your Google Account at:
        http://goo.gl/**** 
        Enter Authorization Code: ******************************* [get from link which shows up above]
        sql> exit
        Bye
        C:\unzipdirectory>

**script execution**

* After installation, any of the scripts should be runnable from the command line, e.g., ::

    $ updatemembers --version
